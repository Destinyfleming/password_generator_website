# password_generator_website

In this project I wrote the Javascript for a website to prompt a user to pick through a list of criteria and for the code to generate a random password based off the criteria.

You can find a screenshot of the website here : 
<img
src = "./assets/images/password-gen.png"
raw=true
alt=“Subject password generator screenshot”
style=“margin-right: 10px;”
/>

I also linked the hosted webpage here:
